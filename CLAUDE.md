# TaskFlow

Modern task management platform built with Next.js 14, SQLite, and NextAuth.

## Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router) + React 18 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Lucide React icons
- **Database**: SQLite via better-sqlite3 (`/data/taskflow.db`, auto-initialized)
- **Auth**: NextAuth.js v4 (credentials provider, JWT sessions, bcryptjs)
- **Validation**: Zod
- **Rich Editor**: TipTap (tables, images, colors, alignment, links, highlights)
- **Deployment**: Docker → GHCR (`ghcr.io/p051xn1nja/taskflow:latest`)

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — Start dev server
- `npm run build` — Production build (standalone output)
- `npm run start` — Start production server
- `npm test` — Run test suite (Vitest, single run)
- `npm run test:watch` — Run tests in watch mode

```

## Database

Schema is defined inline in `src/lib/db.ts` and auto-creates on startup.
Tables: `users`, `categories`, `statuses`, `tasks`, `tags`, `task_tags`, `notes`, `note_tags`, `note_tasks`, `note_attachments`, `attachments`, `platform_settings`.
SQLite runs in WAL mode with foreign keys enabled.

### Statuses System

Task workflow stages are user-defined via the `statuses` table:
- `statuses` table: `(id, user_id, name, color, position, is_completed, is_default, created_at)`
- Each user gets 3 default statuses seeded on first access: "To Do" (default), "In Progress", "Completed" (is_completed=1)
- `tasks.status_id` references `statuses.id` — the legacy `tasks.status` column is kept in sync for backwards compat
- `is_completed` flag determines done behavior (strikethrough, progress=100, opacity)
- `is_default` marks which status new tasks get and where tasks go when their status is deleted
- `position` controls column order on the Board view
- `tasks.board_position` stores the manual card order within a column (used when sort is "Manual")
- Deleting a status reassigns all its tasks to the default status with progress=0
- **Auto-status logic** (in `PATCH /api/tasks/:id`):
  - Setting progress to 1-99% (without explicit status) auto-assigns the "In Progress" status
  - Sending legacy `status='completed'` auto-resolves `status_id` to the user's completed status (and vice versa for `in_progress`)
  - Sending `status_id` auto-syncs the legacy `status` column

### Tags System

Tags are managed via a master `tags` table with `(id, user_id, name, color)`. Tags are shared between tasks and notes:
- `task_tags` junction: `(id, task_id, tag_id)` — links tags to tasks
- `note_tags` junction: `(id, note_id, tag_id)` — links tags to notes
- Migration from old free-form `task_tags.name` to master tag references is handled automatically in `db.ts`

### Notes System

Notes have their own content model alongside tasks:
- `notes` table: `(id, user_id, title, content, color, created_at, updated_at)` — content is HTML from the rich editor; color is optional hex for card accent
- `note_tags`: Links notes to tags
- `note_tasks`: Links notes to tasks (many-to-many)
- `note_attachments`: File attachments for notes (same schema as `attachments`)

## Deployment

- **Domain**: `task.sidecloud.net`
- **Port**: 7776 → container 3000
- **Image**: `ghcr.io/p051xn1nja/taskflow:latest`
- **CI**: GitHub Actions builds and pushes to GHCR on push to `main` (`.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`)
  - Actions: `actions/checkout@v5`, `docker/login-action@v4`, `docker/metadata-action@v6`, `docker/build-push-action@v6` (Node.js 24-compatible)
- **Volumes**: DB and uploads persist at `/var/www/vhosts/sidecloud.net/docker/taskflow/`
- **Deploy on server**: `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`

## Environment Variables

- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` — Session encryption key (**required in production**; a dev-only fallback is used in development)
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` — Public URL (`https://task.sidecloud.net`)
- `NODE_ENV` — `production` in Docker

> **Security**: Never commit real secrets. The repo uses a clearly-named dev-only fallback for `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`. Production deployments must set this env var to a unique random string.

## Views

- **Tasks** (`/`): List view with filters, search, pagination
  - Tasks grouped by year → month → day with collapsible accordion sections; all collapsed by default except the current year/month/day
  - Year headers show total task count; month headers show task count; day headers show weekday + day number with "Today" badge
  - Search & Filters card uses `relative z-10` to ensure dropdowns render above the collapsible accordion sections below
  - Tag filter is a searchable dropdown/combobox (fetched from `/api/tags`) — type to filter, click to select, clear button to reset
  - Stats cards are dynamic — one card per user-defined status (colored by status), plus Total and Avg Progress; scrollable if many statuses
  - Expanded card view is read-only (description, location, tags with colors, attachments with download)
  - Tag names displayed as colored badges on each task card
  - Progress bar displayed on each card; editing progress is done via the edit modal
  - Checkbox toggles completion: sets status to completed (with `status_id` auto-resolved), progress=100, title struck through
  - Location, start date, and due date shown on each card
  - Action buttons (edit/delete) use `opacity-100 lg:opacity-0 lg:group-hover:opacity-100` — always visible on mobile, hover-reveal on desktop
- **Board** (`/board`): Kanban board with dynamic user-defined columns
  - Columns driven by the user's `statuses` table, ordered by `position`
  - Inline column management: three-dot menu on each column header to rename or delete statuses directly
  - Rename uses inline input field with confirm/cancel; delete shows confirmation (default status cannot be deleted)
  - Users can also manage statuses via the dedicated `/statuses` page
  - HTML5 native drag-and-drop (desktop) with optimistic UI updates
  - **Intra-column reordering**: drag cards within the same column to reorder; a blue drop indicator line shows the insertion point
  - **Cross-column moves**: drag cards between columns to change status; drop on a specific card to insert at that position
  - **Sort modes**: "Manual (drag to reorder)" uses persisted `board_position`; other options: created date, due date, progress, title
  - Dragging to reorder auto-switches sort to "Manual" mode; `board_position` persisted via `POST /api/tasks/reorder`
  - Mobile: long-press a card to select it, then tap a status button to move it (cross-column), use up/down arrows to reorder within column, or tap another card to insert before it
  - Mobile drag banner shows selected card with ring highlight, up/down arrows, helper text, and status column buttons
  - Moving cards updates `status_id` and `progress` via `PATCH /api/tasks/:id`
  - Dragging to a completed-status column sets progress=100; to default sets progress=0
  - Drag-over highlight uses Tailwind ring/border classes (inline styles cleared during drag for proper visibility)
  - Tag names displayed as colored badges on kanban cards
- **Notes** (`/notes`): List view with search, tag filters, pagination — same year → month → day accordion layout as tasks
  - Stats cards: Total (purple), Tagged (brand blue), Linked to tasks (green), This Week (amber) — scrollable row, same pattern as Tasks stats
  - Search & Filters card uses `relative z-10` to ensure dropdowns render above the collapsible accordion sections below
  - Notes grouped by year → month → day (by `updated_at`) with collapsible sections; current year/month/day expanded by default
  - Each note card shows title, content preview (HTML stripped), tags, linked task count, attachment count
  - Color picker dropdown (palette icon) on each card to set a card accent color (18 presets); opens upward to avoid clipping; color shown as colored left border
  - Tag filter is a searchable dropdown/combobox — type to filter existing tags, click to select
  - Click opens a read-only detail modal (title, tags, HTML content, linked tasks, attachments, timestamps); Edit button navigates to full editor
- **Note Editor** (`/notes/:id`): Full-page rich editor with auto-save
  - Color picker in header toolbar and in the RichEditor toolbar to set note card accent color (same 18 presets as notes list)
  - TipTap rich HTML editor: bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, code, headings (H1-H3)
  - Text colors (12 presets, w-8 h-8 buttons), highlight colors (8 presets, w-8 h-8 buttons), text alignment (left, center, right, justify)
  - Bullet lists, ordered lists, blockquotes, horizontal rules, code blocks
  - Tables: insert with configurable rows/cols, add/delete rows/columns, table settings modal (border width, border color, cell padding, width)
  - Images: upload via toolbar button, pasted/dropped images uploaded to `/api/editor-upload`
  - Links: add/remove with URL input
  - Tag management with autocomplete from master tags
  - Task linking: search and link/unlink tasks to notes
  - File attachments: upload (drag-and-drop or browse), download, delete — same limits as tasks
  - Auto-save with 2s debounce + manual save button
- **Calendar** (`/calendar`): Visual calendar view of tasks and notes
  - Four view modes: Day, Week, Month, Year — toggle via toolbar buttons
  - **Monthly**: Classic 7-column grid, items shown as colored pills (category color), "+N more" overflow
  - **Weekly**: 7-column card layout with detailed items per day; task titles colored by category
  - **Daily**: Focused single-day view with items grouped by type (tasks, notes); task titles colored by category
  - **Yearly**: 4x3 mini-month grid with activity dot indicators colored by category, click to drill into month
  - Tasks with both `start_date` and `due_date` render as multi-day bars spanning the date range; task title is shown on every day of the range
  - Tasks shown by `due_date` (or `start_date` for range tasks), notes shown by `created_at`
  - Clicking a task opens a detail modal (fetched via `GET /api/tasks/:id`) showing title, status, category, progress, description, location, dates, tags, attachments with download, and timestamps
  - Task detail modal has an Edit button (pencil icon) that opens the TaskForm edit modal for inline editing; calendar refreshes on save
  - Clicking a note opens a read-only detail modal (same pattern as task detail); Edit button navigates to note editor
  - Filters: category, status, tag, content type (tasks/notes/both)
  - Navigation: prev/next arrows, "Today" quick button
  - Fetch uses AbortController to cancel stale requests on rapid navigation (prevents race condition where old month data overwrites current view)
  - Day-click popup: click any day to get "New Task" / "New Note" options; task pre-fills `start_date` with clicked date
- **Statuses** (`/statuses`): Manage workflow stages for tasks
  - CRUD for statuses with color picker and "marks as completed" toggle
  - Drag-and-drop reordering (changes board column order)
  - Default status indicated with badge; cannot be deleted
  - Shows task count per status
- **Tags** (`/tags`): Dedicated tag management view
  - CRUD for tags with color picker (12 presets + custom hex)
  - Shows task and note usage counts per tag
  - Tags are shared across tasks and notes
- **Edit Modal** (`TaskForm`): Unified edit experience for both list and board views
  - Progress slider (edit mode only) — updates task progress directly
  - File attachments: upload (drag-and-drop or browse), download, and delete
  - Tags with autocomplete dropdown from master tags, colored badges
  - Category, location, start date, due date, title, description editing
  - New files are staged and uploaded on save; attachment deletes are immediate
- **Admin Panel** (`/admin`): Admin-only dashboard
  - **Users** (`/admin/users`): Manage users — activate/deactivate, approve pending registrations, delete
  - **Settings** (`/admin/settings`): Platform-wide settings (registration, approval, limits)

## Testing

- **Framework**: Vitest with in-memory SQLite (no external services needed)
- **Run before submitting**: `npm test` — 110 tests across 8 files, ~3s
- **Test DB helper**: `tests/helpers/test-db.ts` provides `createTestDb()`, `seedUser()`, `seedCategory()`, `seedTask()`, `seedStatuses()`
- **Coverage**: utilities, type contracts, schema constraints, foreign key cascades, CRUD operations, Kanban column mapping, calendar date-range queries, build integrity
- **Adding tests**: Place unit tests in `tests/unit/`, integration tests in `tests/integration/`

## Favicon

- Generated at build time via Next.js `ImageResponse` (no static assets)
- `src/app/icon.tsx` — 32x32 PNG favicon (browser tabs)
- `src/app/apple-icon.tsx` — 180x180 Apple Touch icon (mobile bookmarks)
- Design: white checkmark on brand-blue gradient (`#1a75f5` → `#2a91ff`), rounded corners

## Platform Settings

Managed via Admin → Settings (`platform_settings` table):

- `app_name` — Display name for the app
- `max_tasks_per_user` — Max tasks per user (default: 1000)
- `max_file_size_mb` — Legacy per-file limit; total enforcement is 50 MB per task
- `max_categories_per_user` — Max categories per user (default: 50)
- `allow_registration` — Whether new users can self-register (default: false)
- `require_admin_approval` — New registrations require admin approval before activation (default: false)

## Key Conventions

- First registered user becomes admin
- API routes under `src/app/api/`
- Protected pages use the `(app)` route group
- Default limits: 1000 tasks, 50MB total uploads per task/note (10 files max), 50 categories per user
- Admin approval workflow: when enabled, new users get `pending_approval=true` until an admin activates them
- Tags are centrally managed with colors — shared between tasks and notes
- Statuses are user-defined workflow stages; default 3 seeded per user (To Do, In Progress, Completed)
- Board columns are dynamic — driven by statuses table, fully customizable
- Notes use HTML content via TipTap; editor images uploaded to `/api/editor-upload`
- Note-task linking allows associating notes with related tasks (many-to-many)
- Calendar view shows tasks (by due_date/start_date range) and notes (by created_at) across day/week/month/year views; multi-day task bars display the title on every day
- Calendar task colors use category color (fallback: status color, then default blue); notes use their custom color (fallback: purple `#a855f7`)
- Sidebar order: Tasks, Notes, Board, Calendar, Categories, Tags, Statuses; collapsed mode stacks avatar and logout vertically (flex-col) for centered alignment
- Tasks have `location`, `start_date`, and `due_date` fields; location is displayed on list cards, board cards, and calendar detail modal; calendar renders multi-day bars for range tasks
- Color pickers in tags/statuses/categories use grid-cols-6 gap-3 layout with w-10 h-10 buttons
- Color pickers in the rich text editor use w-8 h-8 buttons with gap-2 spacing; card color picker (w-7 h-7 rounded-full) also available in editor toolbar
- Note card color palette: 18 colors (Red, Rose, Pink, Fuchsia, Purple, Violet, Indigo, Blue, Sky, Cyan, Teal, Emerald, Green, Lime, Yellow, Amber, Orange) + None
- Pagination uses a shared `Pagination` component (`src/components/Pagination.tsx`) with numbered pages, first/last/prev/next arrows; used on Tasks and Notes pages
- All modals, popups, and dropdown menus close on ESC key and click-outside
- Date input calendar picker icons are white (CSS `filter: invert(1)` on `::-webkit-calendar-picker-indicator`)
- Footer with build info ("TaskFlow build 20260320-21-stable by p051xn1nja") shown on all pages via app layout and login page
